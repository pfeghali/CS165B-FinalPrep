UCSB `CS165B` Final Study Guide
---
#### Introduction:
This is an incomplete final study guide.
There is probably material missing from here, albeit most information should be valid.
Do not expect substantive proofs, that's not what this is for. This will be continously updated as the course progresses.
Please email me if you'd like something updated or changed.
